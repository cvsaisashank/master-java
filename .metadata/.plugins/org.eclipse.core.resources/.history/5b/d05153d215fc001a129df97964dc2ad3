	 * Q) What is HashSet
	 * 1. hash table implementation of Set interface. It internally uses HashMap which stores key value pairs.
	 * 2. It permits one null element.
	 * Q) What are its typical usecase usages?
	 * 1. Rapid lookup, insertion and deletion. It does in O(1).
	 * 2. Insertion order is not important.
	 * 3. Better for removeAll() & retainAll()

	 * Q) Why do we need to override hashCode() method to remove duplicates for the below instances?
	 * Book book1 = new Book("Walden", "Henry Thoreau", 1854);
		Book book2 = new Book("Walden", "Henry Thoreau", 1854);
	 * A) We know that HashSet is based on HashMap and HashMap is internally based on HashTable. In HashTable, it has a hash function and this
	 * hash function uses a hashCode method from Object class in order to hash into the hashTable in order to find the correct bucket number. 
	 * Now in order to remove duplicate objects(instances of this class) we need to have the same hash code for all the duplicate objects.
	 * But in this case both of these objects will have a different hash codes. Because hashCode() method is defined in the Object class. 
	 * When HashSet invokes hashCode() method in Object class is invoked for the above example, it will return different hash codes. How the 
	 * hasCode() method is implemented is it returns the memory address of the corresponding object after converting it into an `int` representation.
	 * So both of them are actually two different objects as both of them have two different memory addresses and because of that we get different values 
	 * returned by the hashCode() method in Object class. So we need to override it so that for both these instances we get the same hash value returned. 
	 * In that way HashSet will not add the second instance which is a duplicate of first instance(Book).
