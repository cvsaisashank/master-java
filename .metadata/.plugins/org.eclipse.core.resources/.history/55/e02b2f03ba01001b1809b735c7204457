/* Notes:
 * Q) Are generics invariant?
 * A) Yes. Generics promise is to ensure compile time safety. Invariance also ensure compile time safety. 
 * Q) Give an example to describe how invariance property is applied on Generics?
 * A) Let us consider, a Book is a sub type of Bookmark. Because of Invariance, List<Book> is not a sub type of List<Bookmark>. This is done 
 * to ensure compile time type safety. However for the same type argument, inheritance of Generic types will be good. Meaning, ArrayList<Bookmark> can 
 * be assigned to List<Bookmark> as ArrayList is a sub type of List.
 * Q) Are Arrays covariant and what does that mean?
 * A) Yes. If Book is a sub type of Bookmark then we can assign Book[] to Bookmark
